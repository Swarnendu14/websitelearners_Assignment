Task

As part of our evaluation process, we’d like you to complete a small assignment that would help us assess your skills. Your task involves creating a mini version of a RESTful API for a simple blogging platform.
Here are the specifics:
1. User Registration and Login:
We’d like you to create a registration and login mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
2. Blog Post Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion (CRUD Operations):
Logged-in users should be able to create a blog post, read their own and others’ posts, edit their own posts, and delete their own posts.
3. Commenting Feature:
Logged-in users should be able to comment on their own and others’ posts. Also, they should be able to edit or delete their own comments.
4. Database:
All the data should be stored in a database of your choice. However, we’d like to see your ability to work with relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
5. Documentation:
Please provide clear documentation of your API endpoints, including the necessary HTTP methods, headers, and data structures for request and response bodies.
Your main focus should be on the back-end side, so a front-end user interface isn’t required. However, please make sure your API is properly structured, secure, and ready to interact with a potential front-end.


You can use the programming language you feel most comfortable with, but keep in mind that we mostly use Python and Node.js in our tech stack.
